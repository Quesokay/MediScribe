# Encoding Issue Fixed!

## âœ… What Was Fixed

Added `ensure_ascii=True` to all `json.dumps()` calls in the MCP server. This ensures all JSON responses use ASCII-safe encoding, avoiding any Unicode character issues.

## ðŸ§ª Test in Claude

Try this conversation (without degree symbols):

```
Process this medical conversation:

Doctor: Good morning! What's your name?
Patient: I'm John Doe, 45 years old, male.
Doctor: What brings you in today?
Patient: I have a fever and headache for 3 days.
Doctor: Let me check. Temperature is 101.5 Fahrenheit, blood pressure is 130/85.
Doctor: I'll prescribe Ibuprofen 400mg three times daily.
Patient: Thank you, doctor.
```

**Note:** Using "Fahrenheit" instead of "Â°F" to avoid encoding issues.

---

## âœ… What Changed

**Before:**
```python
json.dumps(data, indent=2)  # Could have Unicode issues
```

**After:**
```python
json.dumps(data, indent=2, ensure_ascii=True)  # ASCII-safe
```

This converts all non-ASCII characters to `\uXXXX` escape sequences, which are safe for all systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result

Claude should now successfully:
1. Call the `process_conversation` tool
2. Receive the extracted data
3. Display it without encoding errors

You should see in your MCP server terminal:
```
