# Restart MCP Server - Encoding Fix Applied

## ✅ Fixed the Encoding Issue!

I've removed all emoji characters from the server logs that were causing the encoding error on Windows.

## 🔄 Restart the Server

### Step 1: Stop Current Server

In the terminal where `mcp_server.py` is running:
- Press **Ctrl+C** to stop it

### Step 2: Start Fresh

```powershell
python mcp_server.py
```

You should now see plain text output without emojis:
```

## 🧪 Test Again in Claude

Now try the same conversation in Claude:

```
Process this medical conversation:

Doctor: Good morning! What's your name?
Patient: I'm John Doe, 45 years old, male.
Doctor: What brings you in today?
Patient: I have a fever and headache for 3 days.
Doctor: Let me check. Temperature is 101.5F, blood pressure is 130/85.
Doctor: I'll prescribe Ibuprofen 400mg three times daily.
Patient: Thank you, doctor.
```

This should now work without encoding errors!

## 🌍 Test Multilingual

After the English test works, try Shona:

```
Process this Shona medical conversation:

Chiremba: Mangwanani. Zita renyu ndiani?
Murwere: Ndini Tendai Moyo, ndine makore 42, murume.
Chiremba: Muri kunzwa sei?
Murwere: Ndine fivha uye kurwara musoro.
Chiremba: Tembiricha yenyu iri pa 38.5 degrees.
Chiremba: Ndichakupai Paracetamol 500mg katatu pazuva.
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

- Removed all emoji characters (🚀, 📝, 🔍, 🌐, 🔬, 💾, 📊, ✓, ⚠️)
- Added UTF-8 encoding handler for stderr
- Replaced arrows (→) with simple text (->)
- All output now uses plain ASCII characters

This ensures compatibility with Windows console encoding.

**Restart the server and try again!** 🎉
