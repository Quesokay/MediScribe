# MediScribe Quick Start Summary

## ‚úÖ What's Working NOW

Your MediScribe system is **up and running**! Here's what you have:

### Current Setup (English-Only)
```bash
python vibe_watcher.py
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic Vibe integration
- ‚úÖ Medical information extraction
- ‚úÖ Patient data (name, age, gender)
- ‚úÖ Symptoms and vital signs
- ‚úÖ Diagnosis and medications
- ‚úÖ Treatment plans
- ‚úÖ Database storage

**Watch Directory:** `Vibe_Transcripts` (in your project folder)

---

## üìÅ How to Use

### 1. Keep the Watcher Running
The terminal window with `python vibe_watcher.py` should stay open and running.

### 2. Save Transcripts from Vibe
Configure Vibe to save transcripts to:
```
C:\Clone_wars\MediScribe\Vibe_Transcripts
```

Or manually copy transcript files there.

### 3. Automatic Processing
When you save a transcript, MediScribe will:
- Detect the new file
- Extract medical information
- Save to database
- Create `*_mediscribe.json` file

### 4. View Records
```bash
python view_database.py
```

### 5. Search Records
```bash
python mediscribe.py --search "Patient Name"
```

---

## üß™ Test It

I created a test file for you. Check if it was processed:

```bash
python view_database.py
```

You should see a record for "John Doe, 45 year old male" with pneumonia diagnosis.

---

## üìä What You Have

### Files Created:
- `Vibe_Transcripts/` - Watch directory
- `Vibe_Transcripts/test_patient.txt` - Test transcript
- `Vibe_Transcripts/test_patient_mediscribe.json` - Extracted data
- `medical_records.json` - Database with all records
- `processed_files.json` - Log of processed files

### Commands:
```bash
# Start watcher
python vibe_watcher.py

# View all records
python view_database.py

# Search patient
python mediscribe.py --search "John Doe"

# Process single file manually
python batch_process.py transcript.txt
```

## üåê About Translation (Not Working Yet)

### Why Translation Isn't Working
Your internet connection timed out downloading the 2.5GB NLLB translation model.

### Options:

**Option 1: Try Again with Better Internet**
When you have faster/more stable internet:
```bash
python vibe_watcher_multilingual.py
```
It will download the model (one-time, ~2.5GB) and then work offline.

**Option 2: Use Google Translate API**
- No large download needed
- Requires API key
- Costs money (~$20/1M characters)
- See `NETWORK_ISSUES_SOLUTION.md`

**Option 3: Manual Translation**
- Transcribe in Shona/Ndebele with Vibe
- Translate manually using online tools
- Save English version
- Process with MediScribe

**Option 4: Wait and Use English Only**
- Use current setup for English transcripts
- Add translation later when needed

4. ‚úÖ Try transcribing and saving a real patient visit

### Soon (This Week):
1. Get familiar with the system
2. Test with multiple transcripts
3. Try search functionality
4. Review extracted data quality

### Later (When Ready):
1. Get better internet connection
2. Download NLLB translation model
3. Switch to multilingual version
4. Test Shona/Ndebele translation

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Watcher Not Detecting Files
- Check file is in `Vibe_Transcripts` folder
- Check file extension (.txt, .srt, .vtt, .json)
- Check watcher is still running

### No Records in Database
- Run `python view_database.py`
- Check `medical_records.json` exists
- Check console output for errors

### Extraction Not Accurate
- Ensure clear medical terminology
- Use complete sentences
- Include keywords like "diagnosis:", "prescribed:", etc.

---

## üí° Tips

1. **Keep watcher running** - Minimize the terminal, don't close it
2. **Review in Vibe first** - Always verify transcription before saving
3. **Use medical terms** - Standard terminology extracts better
4. **Check console** - Watch for processing messages
5. **Backup database** - Copy `medical_records.json` regularly

---

## üìû Quick Help

**View what's in database:**
```bash
python view_database.py
```

**Search for patient:**
```bash
python mediscribe.py --search "John"
```

**Process file manually:**
```bash
python batch_process.py Vibe_Transcripts/transcript.txt
```

**Test extraction:**
```bash
python medical_extractor_simple.py
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

**What works:** English-only automatic processing ‚úÖ
**What doesn't:** Translation (needs model download) ‚ùå
**Solution:** Use English for now, add translation later

**You're ready to start using MediScribe!** üéâ

Just keep the watcher running and save transcripts to the `Vibe_Transcripts` folder.
