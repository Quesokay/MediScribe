# Fresh Start Guide

## âœ… Your System is Working!

The watcher is running successfully. You just have some corrupted test data in the database.

## Clean Start (Recommended)

### 1. Stop the Watcher
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `python vibe_watcher.py`

### 2. Clean Old Data
```bash
# Backup old database (optional)
copy medical_records.json medical_records_backup.json

# Delete old database and logs
del medical_records.json
del processed_files.json
```

### 3. Start Fresh
```bash
python vibe_watcher.py
```

### 4. Test with New File
Create a new test file in `Vibe_Transcripts` folder or use Vibe to save a transcript there.

## What's Working

âœ… **Vibe watcher** - Running and monitoring
âœ… **File detection** - Detects new transcripts
âœ… **Medical extraction** - Extracts patient info
âœ… **Database** - Saves records (just has old corrupted data)

## Quick Test

1. **Stop watcher** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Clean database:**
   ```bash
   del medical_records.json
   del processed_files.json
   ```
3. **Start watcher:**
   ```bash
   python vibe_watcher.py
   ```
4. **Create test file:**
   Save this as `Vibe_Transcripts\patient_test.txt`:
   ```
   Patient Sarah Johnson, 32 year old female.
   Presents with headache and nausea for 2 days.
   Temperature 99.8F, BP 125/80.
   
   Diagnosis: Migraine headache.
   Prescribed Sumatriptan 50mg as needed.
   ```
5. **Check results:**
   ```bash
   python view_database.py
   ```

You should see clean, properly extracted data!

## For Daily Use

### Start Watcher
```bash
python vibe_watcher.py
```

### Configure Vibe
Set Vibe to save transcripts to:
```
C:\Clone_wars\MediScribe\Vibe_Transcripts
```

### View Records
```bash
python view_database.py
```

### Search
```bash
python mediscribe.py --search "Patient Name"
```

## About Translation

Translation isn't working yet due to network timeouts downloading the 2.5GB model.

**Options:**
1. **Use English only** (current setup - works great!)
2. **Try downloading model later** with better internet
3. **Use Google Translate API** (requires API key)
4. **Manual translation** workflow

See `NETWORK_ISSUES_SOLUTION.md` for details.

## Summary

**What works:** Everything except translation! âœ…
**What to do:** Clean old data and start fresh
**What's next:** Use with Vibe for real patient visits

You're ready to go! ðŸŽ‰
