    Doctor: Good morning! What's your name and age?
    
    Patient: Hi doctor. I'm Michael Chen, I'm 35 years old, male.
    
    Doctor: What brings you in today, Michael?
    
    Patient: I've been having severe chest pain for the past 2 days. 
    It gets worse when I breathe deeply or cough.
    
    Doctor: I see. Let me check your vitals. Your blood pressure is 140/90, 
    which is a bit elevated. Temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit. Heart rate is 88 bpm.
    Any other symptoms?
    
    Patient: Yes, I have a persistent cough and some shortness of breath.
    
    Doctor: Have you had any recent injuries or trauma to your chest?
    
    Patient: No, nothing like that.
    
    Doctor: Based on your symptoms, I'm concerned about possible pleurisy or 
    a respiratory infection. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and some blood tests.
    In the meantime, I'll prescribe you Ibuprofen 600mg three times daily for the pain,
    and an antibiotic - Azithromycin 500mg once daily for 5 days.
    
    Patient: Should I be worried?
    
    Doctor: Let's wait for the test results. If the pain gets worse or you have 
    difficulty breathing, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, 
    follow up with me in 3 days with your test results.
    
    Patient: Okay, thank you doctor.

    Doctor: Good afternoon. I have the patient here with their family. 
    Can you introduce yourselves?
    
    Patient: I'm Lisa Martinez, 52 years old, female.
    
    Daughter: I'm her daughter, Maria. I brought her in because she's been 
    having memory problems.
    
    Doctor: Thank you for coming. Lisa, can you tell me what's been happening?
    
    Patient: Well, I've been forgetting things a lot lately. Where I put my keys,
    appointments, even conversations I had yesterday.
    
    Daughter: It's been getting worse over the past 6 months. She also seems 
    confused sometimes and has trouble finding words.
    
    Doctor: I see. Lisa, do you have any headaches, dizziness, or vision problems?
    
    Patient: Sometimes I get headaches, yes. And I feel dizzy when I stand up quickly.
    
    Doctor: Let me check your blood pressure. It's 150/95, which is high. 
    Have you been taking any medications?
    
    Patient: Just my blood pressure medication, but I forget to take it sometimes.
    
    Daughter: That's part of the problem - she forgets her medications.
    
    Doctor: I understand. Based on what you're telling me, we need to do some tests.
    I'm going to order a cognitive assessment, brain MRI, and blood work to check 
    for vitamin deficiencies and thyroid function. These memory issues could be 
    related to several things - medication management, high blood pressure affecting 
    the brain, or early signs of cognitive decline.
    
    For now, I'm going to adjust your blood pressure medication to Amlodipine 10mg 
    once daily. Maria, can you help make sure she takes it every morning?
    
    Daughter: Yes, of course.
    
    Doctor: Good. I'm also prescribing a vitamin B12 supplement. Let's schedule 
    a follow-up in two weeks after we get the test results.
    
    Patient: Will I be okay?
    
    Doctor: We'll figure this out together. The tests will help us understand 
    what's causing these symptoms and how best to treat them.
    
    Daughter: Thank you, doctor.
    
    Doctor: You're welcome. Take care, both of you.
