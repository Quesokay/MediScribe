## Best Practices

1. **Always verify critical information** - AI extraction is helpful but should be reviewed for medical decisions

2. **Use save_to_db=false for testing** - Test extraction before committing to database

3. **Preserve original transcriptions** - Keep raw audio/text for legal compliance

4. **Regular backups** - Export database regularly for disaster recovery

5. **Privacy compliance** - Ensure MCP server runs locally, no cloud transmission

6. **Audit trail** - Record IDs include timestamps for tracking

7. **Error handling** - Review records flagged with missing information
