# Final Encoding Fix

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

1. **Set Windows console to UTF-8** (code page 65001)
2. **Configured stdout and stderr** with UTF-8 encoding
3. **Added `ensure_ascii=True`** to all JSON outputs
4. **Fixed print statements** in medical_extractor_simple.py

---

## üîÑ Restart the Server (IMPORTANT!)

### Option 1: Use the UTF-8 Batch File (Recommended)

```powershell
.\START_SERVER_UTF8.bat
```

This automatically sets UTF-8 encoding before starting the server.

### Option 2: Manual Start

```powershell
chcp 65001
python mcp_server.py
```

## üß™ Test in Claude

Try this simple conversation:

```
Process this medical conversation:

Doctor: Good morning. What is your name?
Patient: I am John Doe, 45 years old, male.
Doctor: What brings you in today?
Patient: I have a fever and headache for 3 days.
Doctor: Let me check. Temperature is 101.5 Fahrenheit, blood pressure is 130 over 85.
Doctor: I will prescribe Ibuprofen 400mg three times daily.
Patient: Thank you doctor.
```

## üêõ If Still Having Issues

### Check the Error Message

In your MCP server terminal, look for the exact error. It should show:
- What line caused the error
- What character caused the problem

### Try Minimal Test

Create a file `test_encoding.py`:
```python
import sys
import io

sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')
sys.stderr = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stderr.buffer, encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')

print("Test: ASCII characters work")
print("Test: Unicode works: ‚úì ‚Üí ¬∞")
```

Run it:
```powershell
chcp 65001
python test_encoding.py
```

If this works, the server should work too.

## üéØ Key Changes

1. **Windows Code Page**: Changed from 437 (DOS) to 65001 (UTF-8)
2. **Stream Encoding**: Both stdout and stderr use UTF-8 with error replacement
3. **JSON Output**: All JSON uses `ensure_ascii=True` for maximum compatibility
4. **Print Statements**: All print to stderr, not stdout

---

**Restart using START_SERVER_UTF8.bat and try again!**
