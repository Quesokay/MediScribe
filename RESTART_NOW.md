# âœ… FINAL FIX - Restart Now!

## What Was Fixed

Found and removed the checkmark character (âœ“) from `translator.py` that was causing the encoding error!

The error was: `'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2713'`

That's Unicode character U+2713 which is the checkmark âœ“

## âœ… This Should Work Now!

All checkmark characters have been removed from:
- âœ… mcp_server.py
- âœ… medical_extractor_simple.py  
- âœ… translator.py

All JSON output uses `ensure_ascii=True`

All print statements go to stderr with UTF-8 encoding

**Restart the server and try again - this should work now!**
