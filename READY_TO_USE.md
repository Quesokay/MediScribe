# ✅ MediScribe is Ready to Use!

## 🎉 What's Fixed

Your MediScribe system had an infinite loop bug that's now **completely fixed**!

### The Problem (Fixed ✅)
The watcher was processing its own JSON output files, creating duplicates forever.

### The Solution
Added smart filtering to skip MediScribe's own output files.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start the Watcher
```bash
python vibe_watcher.py
```

You should see:
```
✓ Vibe-MediScribe Integration Active
✓ Watching: Vibe_Transcripts
✓ File types: .txt, .srt, .vtt, .json
👀 Monitoring for new transcripts...
```

### 2. Test It (Optional)
```bash
python test_fixed_watcher.py
```

This creates a test file and you can verify it processes correctly without duplicates.

### 3. Use with Vibe

**Option A: Configure Vibe**
- Open Vibe → Settings
- Set save directory to: `C:\Clone_wars\MediScribe\Vibe_Transcripts`
- Save transcripts normally

**Option B: Manual Copy**
- Save transcripts anywhere in Vibe
- Copy them to `Vibe_Transcripts` folder
- MediScribe processes automatically

### 4. View Records
```bash
python show_latest.py
```

Or for all records:
```bash
python view_database.py
```

## 📁 File Structure

```
MediScribe/
├── Vibe_Transcripts/          ← Save transcripts here
│   ├── patient_visit.txt      ← Original transcript
│   └── patient_visit_mediscribe.json  ← Extracted data (auto-created)
│
├── medical_records.json       ← Database with all records
├── processed_files.json       ← Processing log
│
└── vibe_watcher.py           ← Keep this running
```

## 🎯 Workflow

```
1. Patient visit happens
   ↓
2. Transcribe with Vibe
   ↓
3. Review transcript in Vibe
   ↓
4. Save to Vibe_Transcripts folder
   ↓
5. MediScribe automatically:
   - Detects new file
   - Extracts medical info
   - Saves to database
   - Creates JSON file
   ↓
6. View/search records anytime
```

## 📊 What Gets Extracted

From each transcript, MediScribe extracts:

✅ **Patient Information**
- Name
- Age
- Gender

✅ **Clinical Data**
- Symptoms
- Vital signs (temperature, BP, etc.)
- Diagnosis
- Medications and dosages
- Allergies

✅ **Care Plan**
- Treatment plan
- Follow-up instructions

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Clear Speech** - Better transcription = better extraction
2. **Use Keywords** - Say "diagnosis:", "prescribed:", "patient name is..."
3. **Complete Sentences** - Helps with context
4. **Review First** - Always verify Vibe's transcription before saving
5. **Consistent Format** - Use similar phrasing for each visit

## 🔍 Commands Reference

```bash
# Start watcher
python vibe_watcher.py

# View latest record
python show_latest.py

# View all records
python view_database.py

# Search by patient
python mediscribe.py --search "Patient Name"

# Test the fix
python test_fixed_watcher.py

# Process file manually
python batch_process.py transcript.txt
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Watcher Not Detecting Files
- Check file is in `Vibe_Transcripts` folder
- Check file extension (.txt, .srt, .vtt, .json)
- Ensure watcher is running
- Check console for errors

### Duplicate Files Appearing
- This was the bug - now fixed!
- If you still see `*_mediscribe_mediscribe.json`, restart the watcher

### No Data Extracted
- Check transcript has medical information
- Use keywords like "diagnosis:", "prescribed:"
- Ensure patient name is clearly stated

### Database Issues
- Run `python show_latest.py` to check
- If corrupted, delete `medical_records.json` and start fresh

## 🌐 About Translation

Translation requires downloading a 2.5GB model (one-time).

**Current Status:**
- ✅ English transcripts work perfectly
- ⏳ Shona/Ndebele translation ready (just needs model download)

**To add translation:**

**Option 1: Automatic Download (Recommended)**
```bash
python download_nllb_model.py
```
This handles slow internet and automatically retries.

**Option 2: Use Google Translate API**
No download needed, but requires API key and costs money.

**See:** `DOWNLOAD_MODEL_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions.
